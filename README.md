###### From petroleum to programming

###### I became interested in programming during my master's studies. this is my final work on that situation. my bad situation


## Abstract of this thesis
```

Having the right decision in every task will make more profit. By using bit dull grading information, 
the average >time,cost to< drill a well could be reduced. The bit wears occur for a variety of reasons,
each of which has a different effect on the shape of drill-bit and its teeth. By properly recording this information,
a proper drill bit can be selected and previous shortcomings can be overcome. We have created a program 
for identifying types and amounts of wear from digital images using image processing. It is then possible
to provide appropriate information in the continuation of drilling and adjacent wells. The model is made
form PDC drilling bit by examining its three major dulls. Digital images are made up of numbers. With the
help of the process of changing the intensity of the components
in an image, its properties can be obtained. To identify and classify the teeth, two models of artificial 
neural network were designed. These models were trained by images dataset and annotation the position and
kind of the  WearTeeth. The amount of wears was obtained using the functions of contour lines. These
functions detect interconnected external lines in an image. The amount of wears was obtained by comparing
the contours with a complete circle. Ultimately; Graphic skins make working with the program easier.

sorry for bugs and mistakes. 

it was overfitting bacause i have low data and do data augmentation on data augmentation
they cant send images to my superVisor
